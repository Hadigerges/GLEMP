# MATLAB Project: Generating lighting effects from matrix patterns.

This is a MATLAB project consisting of manipulating the filling order of matrices in the desired visual geometric shapes.

The attached files (.m format) are the Matlab files that contitute my whole project

## Introduction:
A matrix is a collection of numbers arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. It is used for plotting graphs, statistics and also to do scientific studies in almost different fields, especially in physics, matrices are applied in the study of electrical circuits, quantum mechanics and optics.

This project concerns the manipulation of the matrix’s by its direction. The challenging part of it is to create a program that can fill a matrix in the shape that we desire.

## Writing the program:
As a common technique, filling a zero matrix of a given dimension ‘n’ was the simplest. Progressing in an element-by-element way is done by: Creating two loops of indexes ‘i’ and ‘j’, Defining the new value given for the element A(i,j) by finding a pattern (addition of a constant or a known variable), Convert this pattern to a general formula, and finally Apply this formula to the elements of the matrix.

Once the general formula is found, the remaining part of the program is to control the direction of the matrix by the ‘if’ condition.
